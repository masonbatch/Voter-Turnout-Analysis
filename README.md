This was some basic voter turnout analysis based on an excel file found online and some research on the side from the 2020 election

I wanted to look at if there is any relation between voter turnout in states and registration deadlines that are present. 

To do this I grabbed an excel file from a website, this analysis was done very quickly so there may be errors and does not tell the whole story but it was just something I thought was interesting and wanted to explore.
